# overview
This personal portfolio is a web application built using React, React-bootstrap for styling, and Animate.css for CSS animations. It serves as a showcase for an individual's projects, skills, and experiences. Here's a guide to help you understand the project structure and how to run, test, and deploy it.

# Getting Started
To run the portfolio locally, navigate to the /personal-portfolio directory and use the following commands:
        \\ npm install
        \\ npm start

This will start the development server, and you can view the portfolio in your browser at http://localhost:3000. The page will automatically reload when you make changes.

# Testing
To run tests,use the following command
        \\ npm test
This launches the test runner in interactive watch mode. Refer to the running tests section for more details.

# Deployment
Once you have built the app, it's ready to be deployed. Refer to the deployment section for more information on deploying a React app.

Feel free to customize the content, styles, and animations in the portfolio to make it your own. Happy coding!
